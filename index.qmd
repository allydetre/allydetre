My name is Ally Detre (she/her) and I am a Master's student at Colorado State University in the department of Geosciences. I work with Dr. Daniel McGrath in the Cryospheric Sciences Research Group and my research focuses on evaluating changes in seasonal snowpack in the western United States by utilizing in-situ measurements and remote sensing methodologies. In my free time, I enjoy reading, skiing, running, photography, traveling, and listening to new music.
